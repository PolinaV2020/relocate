      <p class="location__article--paragraph">Named for a local swamp fish, Paraty sits on Brazil's southeastern coast, 125 miles south of Rio, with the Bocaino Mountains at its back. The small colonial town's center is a national historic monument with well-preserved buildings on its pedestrian-only streets. Take a boat trip out into the bay to the flotillas of islands and coves nearby. Explore sugarcane plantations and hike or take a train through Atlantica Forest. Keep an eye out for the monkeys that roam the cobblestone streets.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">The town is located on the Bay of Ilha Grande, which is dotted with many tropical islands. Rising as high as 1,300 meters behind the town are tropical forests, mountains, and waterfalls. It is the southernmost and westernmost city in Rio de Janeiro state.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">The city's economic activity revived as a port for a new boom, the coffee trade of the Paraiba do Sul River Valley in the early 19th century, until a railway along the valley created cheaper transport to the port of Rio de Janeiro. Another smaller revival came late in the 19th century with the production of cachaça, which is a sugarcane-derived spirit best known today as the basis for Brazil's most famous cocktail, the caipirinha.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">There are many musical and cultural events, the most prominent of which is the FLIP – Festa Literaria Internacional de Paraty (International Literary Festival of Paraty). The town is also known for its local festivals on Catholic holy dates, such as the Feast of the Holy Ghost.</p>

      <p class="location__article--paragraph">When the city was founded in 1531, the founders made Nossa Senhora dos Remédios as the patron Saint and built a church in her honor. The center of the city is focused on the pedestrian section of the old town. Here is where the phenomenal Portuguese colonial architecture can be found. In total, the center consists of a 30 block grid, with terraced houses and Baroque churches. The Centro Histórico is easily navigable on foot; it takes only about 5 minutes to get from one end to the other. The church of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios is one of the main monuments of the town, where there are big festivities during a festival in her honor in September. Another church, Santa Rita dos Homens Pardos, is a particularly striking example of 18th century architecture. It has one central altar and two side altars housed in balconies high above. It holds Parati’s Museu de Arte Sacra, where there is a 18th-century terracotta pieta, which was stolen from the Nossa Senhora do Rosário church several years ago and later found in a junk shop in Rio.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">Near Parati lies the Mata Atlantica, which is a lush, unruly jungle metropolis. This Rainforest is Brazil's national treasure. Though The Mata Atlantica once blanketed the entire coast right up to Bahia, now it is now been eaten up by 60 percent.   Thus, there are strict restrictions on deforestation.</p>

      <p class="location__article--paragraph">Paraty is a small town backed by mountains on Brazil's Costa Verde ("green coast") midway between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">Students, international students, interns, backpackers, roomates and digital nomads can book cheap dorms and safe private rooms in downtown Paraty, close to boarding schools, high schools, colleges, halls of residence and universities, close to buses or train stations, airports or major attractions in Paraty.</p>

    <div id="location_tab-history" class="location__article">
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">The Portuguese settled Paraty in the mid-seventeenth century. By the 1800's Paraty had become the second most important port in Brazil because of the gold found in Minas Gerais. This period of wealth brought about the beautiful colonial architecture that is marveled at today. Some of the best pina or cachaca (sugar can liquor) was also produced here as well as coffee that was cultivated in the valley of Paraiba. Today the area is a popular tourist destination, due in part to the inception of the highway BR-101, which connects the town to the inland through the valley of Paraiba.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">The village of Paraty was founded in 1597. It was established formally as a town by Portuguese colonists in 1667, in a region populated by the Guaianás Indians. The Guaianás people who lived where the city now stands called the entire area “Paraty”. In the Tupi language “Paraty” means “river of fish”. Even today the Brazilian Mullet (Mugil brasiliensis) still come back to spawn in the rivers that spill into the Bay of Paraty. When the region was colonized by the Portuguese, they adopted the Guaianás name for their new town.</p>

      <p class="location__article--paragraph">There are many musical and cultural events, the most prominent of which is the FLIP – Festa Literaria Internacional de Paraty (International Literary Festival of Paraty). The town is also known for its local festivals on Catholic holy dates, such as the Feast of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">The annual Paraty Bourbon Jazz Festival has occurred every May since 2009. The traditional music event has already brought names like Stanley Jordan, Gary Brown, Ed Motta, Leo Gandelman, Eumir Deodato, Joshua Redman, Pau Brasil Group, Dianne Reaves, Mike Stern, Naná Vasconcellos, Nuno Mindelis, Jacques Morelenbaum, Stanley Clarke, and many other leading names in jazz, blues, soul and R & B from Brazil and the world.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">The event usually has two stages, located in the Plaza de Matriz and the Santa Rita Church in the historic center of the city, as well as buskers (street performers) and Orleans Street Jazz Band circling the streets of the Historic Center and DJ Crizz that opens and closes programming every day.</p>
      <p class="location__article--paragraph">The Casa da Cultura Paraty (Paraty House of Culture) occupies an historic house originally built in 1754[9] which opened to the public in 2004[10] and holds a permanent exhibition on local history and culture. In the Salon of Indigenous Culture, visitors can see the “carpets” made of colored sawdust and flower petals used during the festival of Corpus Christi in June. The largest is almost 92 square feet (8.5 m2). The “carpet” is protected by glass so that visitors walk on it as they enter.</p>
